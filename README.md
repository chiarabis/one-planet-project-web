# One Planet Project
Website project to be informed about global warming and climate change, monitoring vital signs of our planet and promote good actions.

### Info sources
I have used different public api to access data. Most of them don't require key or authentication (except one: the air quality API). Images are from Pixabay. All the informations are from Nasa website - Climate Change section, articles from Our World in Data, WWF website and Copernicus program website.

### Libraries and tools
I implemented the web app with different libraries.
- Arwes: a sci-fi/futuristic UI libraries
- MUI: a wonderful library of React components
- Chart.js: for costumizable Javascript charts
- FontAwesome: a huge icons library
- Framer Motion: a simple motion library for React
- React Router: for page routing
- Axios: for fetching data from APIs
